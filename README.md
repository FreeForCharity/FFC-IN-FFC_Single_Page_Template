## Using This Repository as a Template

This repository is configured as a GitHub template, making it easy to create your own nonprofit website with all the features and best practices included.

### Quick Template Setup

1. **Click "Use this template"** button at the top of this repository
2. **Create your new repository** with your organization's name
3. **Follow the [Template Usage Guide](./TEMPLATE_USAGE.md)** for complete setup instructions
4. **Review the [Content Replacement Guide](./CONTENT_REPLACEMENT_GUIDE.md)** to identify all content to replace

### AI-Assisted Customization Prompt

If you're using Claude Code (or another coding agent), paste the prompt below into a fresh session with your forked repository open. Fill in the bracketed `[VALUES]` with your charity's real information first — everything else is wired up so the agent edits the right files and runs the right checks.

> **One-line summary:** "Convert this FFC template into a site for `[CHARITY NAME]` by editing `src/lib/site.config.ts`, related public assets, and content data — then run the pre-commit gauntlet."

<details>

```markdown
You are converting this Free For Charity template into a site for a specific
501(c)(3) nonprofit. Read TEMPLATE_CUSTOMIZATION.md first — it maps every
config field to where it surfaces. Then make the changes below as a single
focused commit per logical step. After each step run `npm run check:drift`
and report any new warnings.

## CHARITY INFORMATION

- Display name: [CHARITY NAME]
- One-sentence tagline: [TAGLINE]
- SEO description (1–2 sentences): [DESCRIPTION]
- Card description (shorter, for OG/Twitter previews): [SHORT_DESCRIPTION]
- Production URL (no trailing slash): [https://example.org]
- Twitter/X handle (or empty string ''): [@handle]
- Primary contact email (drives siteConfig.contactEmail and the footer): [hello@example.org]
- Security disclosure email (drives the Contact: line in security.txt only): [security@example.org]
- Vulnerability disclosure path: /vulnerability-disclosure-policy (keep default)
- Social links (used by siteConfig.social; the footer icon is resolved by label):
  - Facebook: [https://www.facebook.com/example]
  - X (Twitter): [https://x.com/example]
  - LinkedIn: [https://www.linkedin.com/company/example/]
  - GitHub: [https://github.com/example]

NOTE: There is only ONE central contact field (`siteConfig.contactEmail`).
`public/.well-known/security.txt` carries its own `Contact:` line because
RFC 9116 requires it on the file itself — set it to the security email
above. The drift guard does not auto-sync the two; keep them aligned by
hand or use the same address for both.

## REQUIRED EDITS

1. src/lib/site.config.ts
   - Update siteConfig: name, tagline, description, shortDescription, url,
     twitterHandle, contactEmail, keywords, themeColor, social.
   - Do NOT change the helper signatures (siteUrl, twitterSite,
     cardDescription) — they're consumed by layout/robots/sitemap.

2. public/CNAME
   - Replace with the production hostname (no scheme, no trailing slash).
   - If launching only on github.io for now, DELETE this file.

3. public/.well-known/security.txt
   - Update Contact, Canonical, Policy, Acknowledgments to the new URL.
   - Bump Expires to ~12 months out, formatted YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ.

4. Web manifest — NO direct edits needed.
   - The manifest is auto-generated from siteConfig by src/app/manifest.ts
     and served at /manifest.webmanifest at build time. Editing
     siteConfig.{name, shortDescription, themeColor} (step 1) updates it.
   - DO NOT add a static public/site.webmanifest back — it was deleted on
     purpose so the values can't drift from siteConfig.

5. public/Images/ and public/Svgs/
   - Replace branded assets. KEEP existing filenames where possible so the
     LCP preload in layout.tsx still hits a real file.
   - Header logo: src/components/header/index.tsx still hardcodes an image
     from a third-party URL (freeforcharity.org WordPress). Replace it
     with a self-hosted asset under /Images/ or /Svgs/ and use
     assetPath().

6. src/data/{faqs,team,testimonials}.ts
   - Replace example content with the charity's real data.

7. src/components/home-page/ sections
   - Update copy, links, and CTAs. Keep accessibility intact (alt text,
     aria-labels, focus styles).

8. Legal pages under src/app/ (privacy-policy, terms-of-service,
   cookie-policy, donation-policy)
   - REVIEW with the charity's counsel before committing. Update org name
     references.

9. .github/workflows/deploy.yml, .github/workflows/lighthouse.yml
   - NO edits required. `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` is now chosen automatically
     based on whether `public/CNAME` is present (empty if CNAME exists,
     `/<repo-name>` if not). Renaming the repo doesn't require a workflow
     edit.

10. README.md, GitHub repo description, CITATION.cff
    - Update organization name, repo links, and citation metadata.

## DO NOT TOUCH

- `scripts/check-drift.mjs` — platform contract (drift enforcement).
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `codeql.yml`, `scorecard.yml`,
  `security-audit.yml`, `security-txt-expiry.yml`, `drift-check.yml`,
  `phantom-revert-guard.yml` — shared CI/security workflows.
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, `.github/workflows/lighthouse.yml` —
  you ONLY edit `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` in these (per step 9). Don't
  change anything else.
- `src/lib/assetPath.ts`, `src/app/manifest.ts`,
  `src/app/sitemap.ts`, `src/app/robots.ts` — shared helpers that
  derive everything from `siteConfig`. Don't hardcode values here.
- `next.config.ts` `output: 'export'` line — required for GitHub Pages.
- `.claude/agents/*.md`, `.claude/rules/*.md` — shared FFC tooling.

## VERIFICATION (run in order, fix any failure before proceeding)

1. npm install
2. npm run format
3. npm run lint
4. npm run check:drift ← MUST be 0 errors; ideally fewer warnings than before
5. npm test
6. npm run build
7. npm run test:e2e

Open a PR titled `chore: initial customization for [CHARITY NAME]`. In the
body include:

- A checklist of every file you touched (drives reviewer focus)
- Output of `npm run check:drift` (proves no new errors)
- Confirmation that legal pages were reviewed by counsel
- The custom domain (or "github.io fallback only" if no domain yet)

## ESCALATION

If you encounter any of the following, STOP and ask before editing:

- A feature the charity needs that the template doesn't have (contact form
  backend, members area, dynamic content). Static export limits options.
- A request to disable security headers, drift checks, or branch protection.
- A request to embed a third-party widget — the new origin must be added to
  BOTH public/\_headers AND the CSP meta tag in src/app/layout.tsx. The
  drift check enforces these two stay in sync; CI will fail on mismatch.
```

</details>

The prompt is intentionally explicit about the **"do not touch"** list and the **escalation** rules so the agent doesn't drift away from FFC best practices while customizing. The `.claude/agents/onboarding.md` agent definition codifies the same flow for sessions that auto-discover available agents.

### Content Customization

The **[Content Replacement Guide](./CONTENT_REPLACEMENT_GUIDE.md)** provides a comprehensive 4-column table identifying every piece of content you need to provide:

- **All website sections** - From navigation to footer, every section documented
- **Current example content** - See what Free For Charity uses
- **Your content column** - Fill in your charity's information

## Overview

This is a single-page website with **100+ component files** organized into multiple sections that showcase Free For Charity's programs, services, and resources. The homepage is composed of scrollable sections (Hero, Mission, Programs, Team, FAQ, etc.), with 7 additional policy pages for legal content. The site includes a global popup system for donations and volunteer signups (codebase includes the infrastructure, though the popups are currently commented out in `layout.tsx`).

### Site Structure

**IMPORTANT:** When new pages or sections are added, explicitly list them here. Keep this documentation up to date.

**Homepage (Single Page Application):**

The main page (`/`) is a single-page application composed of scrollable sections:

- Hero section
- Mission statement
- 2023 Results
- Testimonials
- Volunteer call-to-action
- Support/Donate section
- Endowment Fund features
- Programs overview

npm test              # Headless mode
npm run test:headed   # With browser visible
npm run test:ui       # Interactive UI mode
```

### Current Test Coverage

#### End-to-End Tests (Playwright)

**Logo Visibility Tests** (`tests/logo.spec.ts`)

- ✅ **NavBar Logo Visibility**: Verifies logo appears in top left corner with correct src and alt text
- ✅ **Hero Section Logo Visibility**: Verifies logo appears in hero section with correct src and alt text
- ✅ **Logo Consistency**: Confirms both logos are present simultaneously and use the same image source

**GitHub Pages Deployment Tests** (`tests/github-pages.spec.ts`)

- ✅ **Image Path Compatibility**: Validates logo image paths work for both custom domain and GitHub Pages basePath
- ✅ **Image HTTP Status**: Verifies logo images return 200 OK status codes
- ⏭️ **Image Natural Dimensions** (skipped): Checks image dimensions after load (disabled in CI due to timing issues)

**Test Configuration** (`playwright.config.ts`)

- Uses system Chromium browser to avoid network download issues
- Runs against built static site (`npm run preview`)
- Retries failed tests 2x in CI, 0x locally
- Collects traces on first retry for debugging

Tests run automatically on every push to main via GitHub Actions before deployment.

### Static Code Analysis

**ESLint** (`eslint.config.mjs`)

- ✅ Next.js core-web-vitals and TypeScript rules enabled
- ✅ Runs automatically during build process
- ⚠️ Currently reports 16 warnings - see details below

**ESLint Warning Details:**

The ESLint warnings fall into three categories:

1. **`@next/next/no-img-element` warnings (6 occurrences)** - ⚠️ ACCEPTABLE for this project
   - Files: `header/index.tsx`, `footer/index.tsx`, `endowment-fund/Hero/index.tsx`, `free-charity-web-hosting/About-FFC-Hosting/index.tsx`, `ui/General-Donation-Card.tsx`, `ui/trainingcard.tsx`
   - Issue: Using `<img>` tags instead of Next.js `<Image />` component
   - Why acceptable: This project uses static export (`output: "export"` in `next.config.ts`), which is incompatible with Next.js Image Optimization. We use the `assetPath()` helper to ensure images work correctly on both custom domain and GitHub Pages basePath.
   - Alternative fix: Could suppress these specific warnings or migrate to a custom image component
   - Website impact: Images load correctly but without automatic optimization (WebP conversion, lazy loading). For a static nonprofit site with modest image usage, this is an acceptable tradeoff.

2. **React Hooks warnings - `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` (6 occurrences)** - ⚠️ ACCEPTABLE but could be improved
   - Files: Various accordion components (`Accordion.tsx`, `AccordionBold.tsx`, `Frequently-Asked-Questions.tsx`, `OrangeFaqItem.tsx`, `free-charity-web-hosting/FAQs/index.tsx`) and `cookie-consent/index.tsx`
   - Issue: Calling `setState` synchronously within `useEffect` when animating accordion height or loading preferences
   - Why acceptable: These components work correctly and don't cause performance issues in practice
   - Recommended fix: Use `useLayoutEffect` instead of `useEffect` for DOM measurements, or use CSS transitions with `max-height`
   - Website impact: Accordion animations work correctly. May cause minor cascading renders but not noticeable to users.

3. **React Hooks warnings - Other (4 occurrences)** - ⚠️ ACCEPTABLE but could be improved
   - `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` (2 occurrences): Missing dependencies in `useEffect`
     - Files: `free-charity-web-hosting/ClientTestimonials/index.tsx`, `ui/CallToActionCard.tsx`
     - Impact: Effects may not re-run when dependencies change, but current implementation works as intended
   - `react-hooks/immutability` (2 occurrences): Direct mutation of state values
     - Files: `free-charity-web-hosting/ClientTestimonials/index.tsx`, `home/Testimonials/index.tsx`
     - Issue: Modifying Swiper navigation params directly instead of using setter
     - Impact: Works correctly but violates React best practices
   - These are technical debt items that don't affect functionality but should be addressed in future refactoring

**Summary:**

- 6 warnings are acceptable by design (static export constraint)
- 10 warnings are technical debt that don't affect functionality
- All warnings have been reviewed and determined to be non-blocking
- Website functions correctly despite these warnings

**For detailed technical debt tracking:** See [TECHNICAL_DEBT.md](./TECHNICAL_DEBT.md) for comprehensive documentation of all technical debt items, including these React Hooks warnings, security vulnerabilities, and future refactoring plans.

**TypeScript** (`tsconfig.json`)

- ✅ Strict mode enabled
- ✅ Type checking runs during build

- ✅ Scans JavaScript/TypeScript code for security vulnerabilities
- ✅ Scans GitHub Actions workflows for security issues
- ✅ Runs on push to main, pull requests, and weekly schedule
- 📊 View results in repository Security → Code scanning alerts

**npm audit**

- All dependencies are checked for security vulnerabilities
- Run `npm audit` locally to check for known security issues
- ⚠️ **Known Issues**: As of December 2025, there are 4 low severity vulnerabilities
  - Low: tmp package vulnerabilities affecting Lighthouse CI dev dependency only
  - Impact: Limited to development environment, does not affect production site
  - Fix available via `npm audit fix --force` (may involve breaking changes)
  - These are being monitored and will be addressed through regular Dependabot updates
  - See [TECHNICAL_DEBT.md](./TECHNICAL_DEBT.md) for tracking and prioritization
  - See [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) for detailed information and mitigation steps

**🏆 Recommendation: Cloudflare Pages**

For Free For Charity, **Cloudflare Pages is the better choice** for these reasons:

1. **Most Likely to Stay Free Long-Term**
   - Cloudflare's business model is built on enterprise customers, not small sites
   - Unlimited bandwidth makes it sustainable even as traffic grows
   - No history of restricting free tier features

2. **Unlimited Bandwidth**
   - Vercel's 100GB/month may become restrictive as the nonprofit grows
   - Cloudflare has no bandwidth limits on free tier
   - Better for handling traffic spikes during fundraising campaigns

3. **Better Sustainability Model**
   - Cloudflare Pages is positioned as a competitive feature, not a revenue source
   - Vercel's focus on monetization through usage limits may tighten over time

4. **Good Next.js Support**
   - While Vercel created Next.js, Cloudflare Pages handles static exports excellently
   - This project uses static export (`output: "export"`), so Vercel's edge runtime advantages don't apply

**⚠️ Vercel Considerations**

Vercel is still a good option if you prioritize:

- Slightly better Next.js-specific tooling
- Simpler initial setup for Next.js projects
- Current free tier is adequate for foreseeable traffic

However, the "hobby" designation may be subject to future policy changes, and the 100GB bandwidth limit could become restrictive.

#### Workflow for Creators and Reviewers

Both platforms provide identical workflows:

**Creator:**

1. Create feature branch
2. Make changes and push to GitHub
3. Open pull request
4. Wait for automatic preview deployment (1-3 minutes)
5. Share preview URL from bot comment

**Reviewer:**

1. Open PR on GitHub
2. Click preview URL in bot comment
3. Test the live site in browser (no IDE or local setup needed)
4. Provide feedback on PR
5. Changes automatically deploy on new commits

**Coexistence with GitHub Pages:**

- Keep GitHub Pages for production (ffcworkingsite1.org)
- Use Cloudflare Pages or Vercel for PR previews only
- No conflicts between systems

#### Setting Up Cloudflare Pages (Recommended)

1. **Sign Up/Sign In**
   - Go to [pages.cloudflare.com](https://pages.cloudflare.com)
   - Sign in with GitHub (or create Cloudflare account)

2. **Connect Repository**
   - Click "Create a project" → "Connect to Git"
   - Select "GitHub" and authorize Cloudflare Pages
   - Choose this repository

3. **Configure Build Settings**
   - Framework preset: Select "Next.js (Static HTML Export)"
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Build output directory: `out`
   - Environment variables: Leave `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` unset
     - GitHub Pages needs `/FFC_Single_Page_Template` for subdirectory routing
     - Cloudflare Pages deploys to root, no basePath needed

4. **Enable Preview Deployments**
   - In project settings → Builds & deployments
   - Enable "Enable automatic preview deployments" (should be on by default)
   - Enable "Enable comments on pull requests"

5. **Deploy**
   - Click "Save and Deploy"
   - First build will take 2-3 minutes
   - Future PR preview deployments are automatic

**Result**: Every PR will have a comment like:

```
✅ Preview deployed to https://abc123.ffc-template.pages.dev
🔗 Production: https://ffc-template.pages.dev
```

#### Setting Up Vercel (Alternative)

If you prefer Vercel:

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign in with GitHub
2. Click "Add New..." → "Project"
3. Import this repository
4. Configure:
   - Framework Preset: Next.js
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `out`
   - Leave `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` unset
5. Deploy

Vercel automatically enables PR preview deployments and comments.

## Site Improvements & Capability Gaps

A comprehensive technical analysis comparing this repository to sister sites (freeforcharity-web, ffcadmin.org, KCCF-web) is available in **[SITE_IMPROVEMENTS.md](./SITE_IMPROVEMENTS.md)**.

This document identifies:

- 19 technical capability gaps
- Detailed implementation guidance for each gap
- Priority recommendations and implementation roadmap
- Estimated effort and complexity for each improvement

**Key improvement opportunities:**

- CodeQL security scanning
- Unit testing with Jest
- Code formatting with Prettier
- Lighthouse CI performance monitoring
- Dark mode theming
- Enhanced documentation suite
- And more...

## Common Tasks

- Update homepage content: edit `src/app/page.tsx`
- Change CTA copy: update text in components under `src/app/components`
- Adjust SEO: edit `metadata` in `src/app/layout.tsx`

## Deployment Details

The site is configured for static export and deployed to GitHub Pages:

**Production:**

- Live at: [https://ffcworkingsite1.org](https://ffcworkingsite1.org)
- GitHub Pages URL: [https://freeforcharity.github.io/FFC_Single_Page_Template/](https://freeforcharity.github.io/FFC_Single_Page_Template/)
- Deployment: Automatic via GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
- Trigger: Push to `main` branch
- Build output: Static files in `./out` directory

**Local preview of production build:**

```bash
npm run build    # Build static site
npm run preview  # Preview at http://localhost:3000
```

**Note:** The build process uses `output: "export"` in `next.config.ts` for static site generation compatible with GitHub Pages.

## Notes

- When adding new pages, update `sitemap.ts` to include them in the sitemap
- Static export configuration in `next.config.ts` supports GitHub Pages deployment with basePath
- Cookie consent implementation tracks user preferences in localStorage
- All images use `unoptimized` setting for static export compatibility
- ESLint warnings about `<img>` tags are expected and acceptable for static export configuration
